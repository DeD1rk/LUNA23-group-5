"Deep Learning for Malignancy Risk Estimation of Pulmonary Nodules Detected at Low-Dose Screening CT"
They only did malignancy prediction. They used 9 2D slices and an existing 3D model (usually used on videos) to classify the images.

"Benign-malignant classification of pulmonary nodule with deep feature optimization framework"
Utilizing a deep feature optimization framework DFOF to enhance bening-malignant classification. This is achieved by spliting the network in 2 streams. One searching for intranodular and perinodular features and the other for revealing intranodular information.

4. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895611121000343#sec0010 " On the performance of lung nodule detection, segmentation and classification" (2021). Gives a review of many algortihms and their accuracies. Small thing about multi task learning and that it is effective. Probs mostly relevant for when we are writing the paper.
